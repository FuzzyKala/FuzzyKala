## About

I'm an Electrical Engineer transitioning to Software Development, currently studying at Oulu University of Applied Sciences (OAMK) in Finland since 2023. With 8+ years as an on-site service engineer across Asia, America, and Europe, I bring strong problem-solving skills and a commitment to delivering technical solutions under deadlines.

## Background

**Engineering Career (2015-2023)**
Worked as an on-site service engineer specializing in industrial control systems. Managed projects internationally, collaborating with customers across continents in multicultural environments. Key skills included AutoCAD, PLC/DCS programming (IEC 61131-3), and HMI design.

**Software Development Journey (2023-Present)**
Made the leap to software development to pursue my passion for creating modern applications. Now building full-stack web and mobile projects, applying my engineering mindset to code.

**Beyond Coding**
When I'm not programming, you'll find me at the gym 4x/week, watching anime, or working at a sushi restaurant üç£. Music lover who discovers old songs and plays them on repeat until every lyric is memorized - currently obsessed with [JENNIE x The Weeknd x Lily-Rose Depp - "One Of The Girls"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx92lTYxrJQ) üéµ.
