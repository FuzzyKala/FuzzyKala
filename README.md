## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam, I was born and raised in Taiwan, and I've studied at Oulu Universiity of Applied Science(OAMK) since 2023 autumn.<br>

In 2022, I realized that I'd like to change my career to be a software programer, so I applied the Finland joint application.<br>
Now, here I am ðŸ˜„.

Tools I'm learning right now:<br>
